Basic
---------
This folder consists of both a node server app and a web application. The node part is really 
a small self-contained server. There's no real serverside functionality here. The focus is 
on the client-side apps within the www* folders.  

Usage

Install node.js

From the command line run: 
node -absulote path to main.js-
